# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add the missing “Toiletries” category to the Store Home page category list and ensure the label is correctly spelled in all user-facing text.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Store Home “Shop by Category” data/list to include a category labeled “Toiletries”.
- Fix any existing user-facing misspelling to “Toiletries”.
- Ensure the new category card renders consistently with existing category cards (icon + name + item count) and preserves the grid layout on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Store Home page, users see a “Toiletries” category in the “Shop by Category” grid, correctly spelled and displayed consistently without layout issues.
