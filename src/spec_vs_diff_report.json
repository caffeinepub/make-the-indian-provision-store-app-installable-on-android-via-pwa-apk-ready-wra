  "summary": "Core category support was added across backend and vendor UI (ProductCategory enum, Product.category field, vendor required dropdown, and a canonical frontend category list). However, the backend does not explicitly reject invalid categories as required (it relies on the enum type), and an unrequested migration mechanism/file was introduced, which also conflicts with the constraint that all backend logic remain in backend/main.mo.",

      "reason": "The updated addProduct method accepts a ProductCategory variant and stores it, but there is no explicit allowlist validation/trap shown for categories. The requirement explicitly calls for rejecting categories not in the predefined list.",
